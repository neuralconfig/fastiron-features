Feature Description MACsec support on the ICX 7850 Refer to the FastIron Software Licensing Guide for information about getting a MACsec license for an ICX 7850. LRM adapter module support on the ICX 7850 Ruckus ICX7150, ICX7250, ICX7750, and ICX 7850 Ethernet switches require a long-Reach Multimode (LRM) adaptor module to support LRM optics connections. New Software Features in 08.0.90 The following software features and enhancements are introduced in this release. Refer to the FastIron Features and Standards Support Matrix, available at www.ruckuswireless.com, for a detailed listing of feature and platform support. Feature Description Software upgrade using a Unified FastIron Image (UFI) on the ICX 7850 A Unified FastIron Image (UFI), consisting of the application image, the boot code image, and the signature file, can be downloaded in a single file. Beginning with FastIron 08.0.90, any new ICX hardware platform (starting with the ICX 7850) will use only UFIs. FastIron 08.0.90 support for the new ICX 7850 Switch Nearly all FastIron features are supported on the ICX 7850, with the exception of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection, Campus Fabric, and OpenFlow. To see a detailed list of the specific features that are supported, refer to the FastIron Features and Standards Support Matrix, Release 08.0.90. Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol (MVRP) MVRP is an IEEE 802.1ak Multiple Registration Protocol (MRP) application that allows dynamic VLAN configuration and distribution of VLAN membership information in a bridged local area network. An MVRP-aware switch can exchange VLAN configuration information with other MVRP-aware switches, prune unnecessary broadcast and unknown unicast traffic, and dynamically create and manage VLANs on switches. With MVRP, an access switch can be manually configured with all the desired VLANs for the network, and all other switches on the network can learn those VLANs dynamically. When the VLAN configurations on a switch are changed, MVRP automatically changes the VLAN configurations in the required switches. LLDP on by default The system enables the LLDP feature globally by default during boot up, for standalone switches and stacking mode. Applies only to new ICX switches from the factory or those that have been set back to the default configuration. Not supported in Campus Fabric implementations. Default username and password The device allows initial access only after using the default local username (super) and password (sp-admin). The administrator will be prompted to change the default password after logging in for the 1st time. ICX devices that are already deployed with a previous release and upgraded to 08.0.90 will not be affected by this change. SSH enabled by default This feature provides SSH access to the device out of the box, without the need for manual intervention to generate SSH keys. LAG between different default port speeds Config speed validation is performed as part of port addition to LAG, and ports with same config speed as that of the virtual LAG interface are accepted. This new feature adds validation of the duplex of the ports against the vlag interfaces in addition to the configuration speed validation. MSTP path-cost configuration This feature is enhanced to support MSTP in a range of ports. FastIron 08.0.90mc for RUCKUS ICX Switches Release Notes, Version 1 14 Part Number: 53-1005731-01 New in This Release Software Features Feature Description TCP MSS TCP MSS Adjustment feature is to avoid the overhead of fragmentation of the TCP data packet and to prevent TCP sessions getting time out due to non- support of fragmentation in the path. Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) BFD is a lightweight hello protocol, with little system overhead, used to rapidly detect link faults without overloading the system. BFD improves network performance by providing fast forwarding path failure detection times, switching traffic to an alternate path when necessary, in order to minimize traffic loss. BFD works by checking that the next-hop device is alive, thus providing rapid detection of the failure of a forwarding path. BFD can detect the failure of the forwarding plane in a sub-second time interval that is user-configurable. Supported on the ICX 7750 only. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) Server DHCPv6 is a network protocol for configuring IPv6 hosts with IP addresses, IP prefixes, and other configuration data required to operate in an IPv6 network. All FastIron devices can be configured to function as DHCPv6 servers. DHCPv6 Server functions in the same manner as DHCP for IPv4, allocating temporary or permanent network IPv6 addresses to clients. DHCPv6 Server also allows for greater control of address distribution within a subnet. Forwarding Profiles Forwarding Profiles allows for the configuration of the Unified Forwarding Table (UFT) so that it suits deployment requirements. A predefined forwarding profile can be selected based on scaling requirements. This UFT partition is carried out during the initialization process and is effective after a system reload. Supported on the ICX 7850 only. IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Proxy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery(ND) Proxy enables the hosts in different broadcast domains or VLANs to communicate with each other. An IPv6 Proxy-enabled interface responds to a neighbor discovery request on behalf of host connected to another interface. Syslog messages for xSTP Syslog messages for xSTP inform if the CPU utilization is higher than the normal value and the BPDU processing rate is higher than the threshold limit. Syslog messages are generated depending upon the received STP or PVST BPDUs. Packet Statistics Enhancement This enhancement enables the system to count packets destined to the CPU based on programmable fields. The user can define the maximum unique field matches to be counted. ICX 7850 stacking Traditional stacks of up to 12 ICX 7850 units are supported Interactive-setup for stacking replaces stack secure-setup The stack interactive-setup command is introduced to streamline and assist in stack configuration. The stack secure-setup command is deprecated. Zero-touch provisioning for stacking The stack zero-touch-enable command is introduced to allow automatic stack configuration. Elimination of required default-ports configuration The default-ports command is deprecated beginning with this release. Configuring stacking ports is simplified. Two-unit linear-topology stacking trunks From this release, two-unit linear-topology trunks are supported on all ICX stackable models. The linear-topology trunk doubles the bandwidth of the stacking ports between two units and provides the same redundancy as a two- unit ring through trunk load balancing. New configuration rules for stacking ports and trunks Using the stack-port and stack-trunk commands is more intuitive, and some previous restrictions have been eliminated.

FastIron 08.0.95pb1 for RUCKUS ICX Switches Release Notes Version 1 Part Number: 53-1005838-01 17 New in This Release Important Notes Feature Description Inter-VRF route leaking using static routes VRF route leaking between different VRFs allows you to share selective route information between different VRFs. Inter-VRF route leaking allows leaking of route prefixes from one VRF instance to another VRF instance on the same physical router, which eliminates the need for external routing. L3 syslog for IPv6 route table exhaust Added Syslogs that indicate the routing table is full. VxLAN support VXLAN support is extended to ICX 7650 and ICX 7850. Important Notes If a fiber optic transceiver is unplugged and plugged in again rapidly, the link may not come up. Allow a delay of 2 to 5 seconds between unplugging and reinserting the optic to ensure optic detection and that the link comes up without issues. ICX 7150, ICX 7250, ICX 7450 PoE not working The ICX 7150, ICX 7250, and ICX 7450 devices with PoE FW version 2.1.8 can have PoE not working on any of the ports. Use FastIron release 08.0.95pb1 to correct this issue. The FastIron release 08.0.95pb1 used PoE firmware 1.8.8 instead of 2.1.8. Important Changes in Release 08.0.95h Per Technical Support Bulletin TSB 2022-005 - Starting with release 8.0.95h/9.0.10d, products running a newer Power Over Ethernet (PoE) chipset do not support older releases, the POE functionality in ICX 7150 and ICX 7450 devices that have the new MCU PD69220 will not be allowed to join a stack running a pre-08.0.95h software image. The MCU PD69220 can be indenified by the #show inline power detail command. device# show inline power detail \u205e Firmware Version ---------------- 02.2.4 Build 002 If you are installing an ICX 7150 or ICX 7450 device that contains MCU PD69220, you can prevent the POE capabilities of the device from being disabled by upgrading the stack to FastIron 08.0.95h or later firmware prior to installing the ICX 7150 or ICX 7450 device. Refer to the Technical Support Bulletins page for more details. Changed Behavior in Release 08.0.95 Please note that Campus Fabric is supported in 08.0.95 and will continue to be supported in 08.0.95 maintenance releases. Campus Fabric will not be supported in later FastIron releases, such as 09.0.10a. Refer to the Software Features on page 14 section for a list of new features in the 08.0.95 release.

Important Changes in Release 09.0.10j Enabling SSH Communication Between 09.0.10j Devices and 08.0.95 Devices Due to the differences in default key exchange and host key algorithms in different FastIron releases, devices running different releases may experience SSH connection issues. For devices running FastIron release 09.0.10a to 09.0.10h, when trying to establish an SSH connection with a device running FastIron release 08.0.95 or earlier, a mismatch in algorithms prevents the SSH connection from being established. The problem arises during the negotiation phase, where the server offers key exchange and host key algorithms that are not compatible with the default settings of the device running FastIron release 09.0.10a to 09.0.10h. For devices running FastIron release 09.0.10j and later, RUCKUS recommends configuring specific key exchange and host key algorithms on the devices to resolve this issue and enable SSH communication.

Flexlink Flexlink is a link redundancy feature that provides Layer 2 resilience. It is an alternative solution to Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) as it provides link redundancy at a faster network convergence rate than STP and its variants RSTP/ MSTP. IP Based MLD Snooping IP based MLD snooping is a functional enhancement that ensures multicast forwarding entries use Group Address, Source Address, and VLAN as key from this release onwards. This change can now start supporting source-specific multicast deployment scenarios. VXLAN on the ICX 7550 VXLAN support is extended to the ICX 7550 devices. PTP support on ICX 7550 and ICX 7650 PTP support is extended to ICX7550-24F, ICX7550-48F, ICX7650-48F, and ICX7650-48ZP devices.

For devices running FastIron release 09.0.10 and later, when trying to establish an SSH connection with a device running FastIron release 08.0.95 or earlier, a mismatch in algorithms prevents the SSH connection from being established. The problem arises during the negotiation phase, where the server offers key exchange and host key algorithms that are not compatible with the default settings of the device running FastIron release 09.0.10 or later. For devices running FastIron release 10.0.10c and later, RUCKUS recommends configuring specific key exchange and host key algorithms on the devices to resolve this issue and enable SSH communication. Perform the following procedure to enable SSH communication with devices running FastIron release 08.0.95 or earlier: device# configure terminal device(config)# ip ssh key-ex key-exchange-method SSH key exchange method device(config)# ip ssh key-exchange-method ASCII string Enter algorithms separated by a space: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256 diffie-hellman-group14-sha256 diffie-hellman-group16-sha512 diffie-hellman-group18-sha512 curve25519-sha256@libssh.org diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 ecdh-sha2-nistp256 ecdh-sha2-nistp384 ecdh-sha2-nistp521 curve25519-sha256 device(config)# ip ssh key-exchange-method diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 device(config)# ip ssh host host-key-method SSH host key method device(config)# ip ssh host-key-method ASCII string Enter algorithms separated by a space: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 ecdsa-sha2-nistp384 rsa-sha2-512 rsa-sha2-256 ssh-rsa device(config)# ip ssh host-key-method ssh-rsa ICX 8200 Multigigabit Support in FastIron 10.0.10b ICX 8200 switches with multigigabit support that are shipped with FastIron release 10.0.10b can be downgraded, if necessary, to FastIron release 10.0.10a; however, they should not be downgraded to earlier releases due to driver incompatibilities. In the case of an unintentional downgrade, the switch can be recovered by booting with the golden image using the following steps. 1. Make a console connection to the switch. 2. Continuously enter b to stop at the boot prompt. 3. Enter the command boot_golden_primary or boot_golden_secondary. AAA authentication Behavior Changes in FastIron Release 10.0.10a From FastIron release 10.0.10a, there is a behavior change for the AAA authentication method-list TACACS+ option. The aaa authorization exec default tacacs+ command must be configured before the aaa authentication login default tacacs+ command or the aaa authentication enable default tacacs+ command can be configured.

Switch Priority Changes for Upgrading to FastIron Release 10.0.20a If a switch is to become a root bridge, before upgrading to FastIron release 10.0.20a, the switch priority must be configured to be less than 4096 and the priority of the other switches must be configured to be greater than 4096. If the priority of a switch is less than 4096, the priority will be updated to 0 after the upgrade to FastIron release 10.0.20a. If the switch priority is greater than 4096 and not a multiple of 4096, the priority will be updated to the lower multiple of 4096 after upgrade to FastIron release 10.0.20a. Enabling SSH Communication Between 10.0.10c Devices and 08.0.95 Devices Due to the differences in default key exchange and host key algorithms in different FastIron releases, devices running different releases may experience SSH connection issues. For devices running FastIron release 09.0.10 and later, when trying to establish an SSH connection with a device running FastIron release 08.0.95 or earlier, a mismatch in algorithms prevents the SSH connection from being established. The problem arises during the negotiation phase, where the server offers key exchange and host key algorithms that are not compatible with the default settings of the device running FastIron release 09.0.10 or later. FastIron 10.0.20b_cd3 for RUCKUS ICX Switches Release Notes Version 1 18 Part Number: 53-1005861-02 New in This Release Important Changes For devices running FastIron release 10.0.10c and later, RUCKUS recommends configuring specific key exchange and host key algorithms on the devices to resolve this issue and enable SSH communication. Perform the following procedure to enable SSH communication with devices running FastIron release 08.0.95 or earlier: device# configure terminal device(config)# ip ssh key-ex key-exchange-method SSH key exchange method device(config)# ip ssh key-exchange-method ASCII string Enter algorithms separated by a space: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256 diffie-hellman-group14-sha256 diffie-hellman-group16-sha512 diffie-hellman-group18-sha512 curve25519-sha256@libssh.org diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 ecdh-sha2-nistp256 ecdh-sha2-nistp384 ecdh-sha2-nistp521 curve25519-sha256 device(config)# ip ssh key-exchange-method diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 device(config)# ip ssh host host-key-method SSH host key method device(config)# ip ssh host-key-method ASCII string Enter algorithms separated by a space: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 ecdsa-sha2-nistp384 rsa-sha2-512 rsa-sha2-256 ssh-rsa device(config)# ip ssh host-key-method ssh-rsa ICX 8200 Multigigabit Support in FastIron 10.0.10b ICX 8200 switches with multigigabit support that are shipped with FastIron release 10.0.10b can be downgraded, if necessary, to FastIron release 10.0.10a; however, they should not be downgraded to earlier releases due to driver incompatibilities. In the case of an unintentional downgrade, the switch can be recovered by booting with the golden image using the following steps. 1. Make a console connection to the switch. 2. Continuously enter b to stop at the boot prompt. 3. Enter the command boot_golden_primary or boot_golden_secondary. AAA authentication Behavior Changes in FastIron Release 10.0.10a From FastIron release 10.0.10a, there is a behavior change for the AAA authentication method-list TACACS+ option. The aaa authorization exec default tacacs+ command must be configured before the aaa authentication login default tacacs+ command or the aaa authentication enable default tacacs+ command can be configured. If you attempt to configure either of these commands first, the following message is displayed: Warning- Please configure exec authorization using TACACS+ to get user privilege. From FastIron release 10.0.10a, there is also a behavior change for the AAA authentication method-list RADIUS option. The aaa authorization exec default radius command must be configured before the aaa authentication login default radius command or the aaa authentication enable default radius command can be configured. If you attempt to configure either of these commands first, the following message is displayed: Warning- Please configure exec authorization using RADIUS to get user privilege. FastIron 10.0.20b_cd3 for RUCKUS ICX Switches Release Notes Version 1 Part Number: 53-1005861-02 19 New in This Release Known Behavior Strict Password Enforcement Available in FastIron Release 10.0.10 Strict password enforcement, reintroduced in FastIron release 10.0.00a, is also available from FastIron release 10.0.10. When strict password enforcement is enabled, new passwords must be a minimum of 15 characters and must meet other requirements. Refer to the RUCKUS FastIron Security Configuration Guide for configuration details. Known Behavior This section describes known behaviors for certain RUCKUS ICX devices and recommended workarounds where they exist. In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) to FastIron 10.0.20a is Not Supported In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) from prior 10.0.20 FastIron releases to FastIron release 10.0.20a is not supported. Users must reboot the entire stack for the upgrade process to complete. ISSU from FastIron Release 10.0.20a to later releases in the same release stream is supported. ICX 7550 Port LED in PoE Mode When a RUCKUS ICX7550-24ZP or a RUCKUS ICX 7550-48ZP device is operating in PoE mode and the user connects a PD to a 10-Gbps port, the port LED comes up green but immediately goes to amber, although the expected LED color is green. When the PD is connected while the ICX device is not in PoE mode and is then placed in PoE mode, the port LED remains green as expected. Workaround: If you encounter the issue, change the device to any other mode, or rotate to the PoE mode again. The LED will then work as expected.",
