FastIron 08.0.90mc for RUCKUS ICX Switches Release Notes, Version 1 Part Number: 53-1005731-01 25 Software Upgrade and Downgrade Open Source and Third Party Code NOTE Please note the following recommendations and notices: \u2022 Inline power is enabled by default as of FastIron release 08.0.70. \u2022 As of FastIron release 08.0.70 legacy-inline-power configuration is disabled by default. \u2022 Data link operation is decoupled from inline power by default as of FastIron release 08.0.70. \u2022 Use the [no] inline power command to enable and disable POE on one or a range of ports. \u2022 Data link operation is coupled with inline power using the command inline power ethernet x/x/x couple-datalink in Priviliged EXEC mode or in interface configuration mode using the command inline power couple-datalink. The PoE behavior remains the same as in releases prior to 08.0.70 (08.0.30, 08.0.40, 08.0.50, 08.0.61). \u2022 Do not downgrade PoE firmware from the factory installed version. When changing the PoE firmware, always check the current firmware version with the show inline power detail command, and make sure the firmware version you are installing is higher than the version currently running. \u2022 The PoE microcontrollers are pre-programmed at the factory. The firmware can be loaded as an external file. The PoE firmware version string will be kept updated to match the corresponding FastIron software version; however, this is only a cosmetic change, and the firmware itself remains unchanged. If a new version of the code is released, Ruckus Technical Support will notify its customers of the needed code upgrade. Finally, in the remote case that a failure occurs during an upgrade process, the switch would still be functional but without PoE circuitry. If you encounter such an issue, please contact Ruckus Technical Support. \u2022 PoE firmware will auto upgrade to version 2.1.0 fw during the loading of FastIron Release 08.0.80. This auto upgrade of the PoE firmware will add approximately 10 minutes to the loading of FastIron Release 08.0.80 on ICX 7150, ICX 7250, ICX 7450, and ICX 7650 devices.

New Software Features in 08.0.90 The following software features and enhancements are introduced in this release. Refer to the FastIron Features and Standards Support Matrix, available at www.ruckuswireless.com, for a detailed listing of feature and platform support. Feature Description Software upgrade using a Unified FastIron Image (UFI) on the ICX 7850 A Unified FastIron Image (UFI), consisting of the application image, the boot code image, and the signature file, can be downloaded in a single file. Beginning with FastIron 08.0.90, any new ICX hardware platform (starting with the ICX 7850) will use only UFIs. FastIron 08.0.90 support for the new ICX 7850 Switch Nearly all FastIron features are supported on the ICX 7850, with the exception of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection, Campus Fabric, and OpenFlow. To see a detailed list of the specific features that are supported, refer to the FastIron Features and Standards Support Matrix, Release 08.0.90. Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol (MVRP) MVRP is an IEEE 802.1ak Multiple Registration Protocol (MRP) application that allows dynamic VLAN configuration and distribution of VLAN membership information in a bridged local area network. An MVRP-aware switch can exchange VLAN configuration information with other MVRP-aware switches, prune unnecessary broadcast and unknown unicast traffic, and dynamically create and manage VLANs on switches. With MVRP, an access switch can be manually configured with all the desired VLANs for the network, and all other switches on the network can learn those VLANs dynamically. When the VLAN configurations on a switch are changed, MVRP automatically changes the VLAN configurations in the required switches. LLDP on by default The system enables the LLDP feature globally by default during boot up, for standalone switches and stacking mode. Applies only to new ICX switches from the factory or those that have been set back to the default configuration. Not supported in Campus Fabric implementations. Default username and password The device allows initial access only after using the default local username (super) and password (sp-admin). The administrator will be prompted to change the default password after logging in for the 1st time. ICX devices that are already deployed with a previous release and upgraded to 08.0.90 will not be affected by this change. SSH enabled by default This feature provides SSH access to the device out of the box, without the need for manual intervention to generate SSH keys. LAG between different default port speeds Config speed validation is performed as part of port addition to LAG, and ports with same config speed as that of the virtual LAG interface are accepted. This new feature adds validation of the duplex of the ports against the vlag interfaces in addition to the configuration speed validation. MSTP path-cost configuration This feature is enhanced to support MSTP in a range of ports. FastIron 08.0.90mc for RUCKUS ICX Switches Release Notes, Version 1 14 Part Number: 53-1005731-01 New in This Release Software Features Feature Description TCP MSS TCP MSS Adjustment feature is to avoid the overhead of fragmentation of the TCP data packet and to prevent TCP sessions getting time out due to non- support of fragmentation in the path. Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) BFD is a lightweight hello protocol, with little system overhead, used to rapidly detect link faults without overloading the system. BFD improves network performance by providing fast forwarding path failure detection times, switching traffic to an alternate path when necessary, in order to minimize traffic loss. BFD works by checking that the next-hop device is alive, thus providing rapid detection of the failure of a forwarding path. BFD can detect the failure of the forwarding plane in a sub-second time interval that is user-configurable. Supported on the ICX 7750 only. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) Server DHCPv6 is a network protocol for configuring IPv6 hosts with IP addresses, IP prefixes, and other configuration data required to operate in an IPv6 network. All FastIron devices can be configured to function as DHCPv6 servers. DHCPv6 Server functions in the same manner as DHCP for IPv4, allocating temporary or permanent network IPv6 addresses to clients. DHCPv6 Server also allows for greater control of address distribution within a subnet. Forwarding Profiles Forwarding Profiles allows for the configuration of the Unified Forwarding Table (UFT) so that it suits deployment requirements. A predefined forwarding profile can be selected based on scaling requirements. This UFT partition is carried out during the initialization process and is effective after a system reload. Supported on the ICX 7850 only. IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Proxy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery(ND) Proxy enables the hosts in different broadcast domains or VLANs to communicate with each other. An IPv6 Proxy-enabled interface responds to a neighbor discovery request on behalf of host connected to another interface. Syslog messages for xSTP Syslog messages for xSTP inform if the CPU utilization is higher than the normal value and the BPDU processing rate is higher than the threshold limit. Syslog messages are generated depending upon the received STP or PVST BPDUs. Packet Statistics Enhancement This enhancement enables the system to count packets destined to the CPU based on programmable fields. The user can define the maximum unique field matches to be counted. ICX 7850 stacking Traditional stacks of up to 12 ICX 7850 units are supported Interactive-setup for stacking replaces stack secure-setup The stack interactive-setup command is introduced to streamline and assist in stack configuration. The stack secure-setup command is deprecated. Zero-touch provisioning for stacking The stack zero-touch-enable command is introduced to allow automatic stack configuration. Elimination of required default-ports configuration The default-ports command is deprecated beginning with this release. Configuring stacking ports is simplified. Two-unit linear-topology stacking trunks From this release, two-unit linear-topology trunks are supported on all ICX stackable models. The linear-topology trunk doubles the bandwidth of the stacking ports between two units and provides the same redundancy as a two- unit ring through trunk load balancing. New configuration rules for stacking ports and trunks Using the stack-port and stack-trunk commands is more intuitive, and some previous restrictions have been eliminated.

Follow these instructions to avoid or correct the issue. Advisory Overview Affected Software Versions: FI 08.0.90a and later releases Affected products: ICX 7850-48F, ICX 7850-FS Symptoms: Unexplained system reboot loop Summary: Copper transceiver 10G-SFPP-TX-A consumes more power than the normal 10-Gbps port with a typical SFP. The recommendations and restrictions in this section are provided to ensure safe operation of the transceiver. If you do not follow these recommendations, there is a risk of system instability and reboot. Damage to the circuit board and power supply may also occur. NOTE From Release FI 08.0.90c, when the transceiver is plugged in, a warning will appear advising what actions to take to avoid any power violation. The following table describes ports that must be left open to avoid power violation. TABLE 1 Affected Hardware and Required Actions ICX Model 10G-SFPP-TX-A Installed Location Required Number of Unused SFP Ports for Each 10G- SFPP-TX-A installed ICX 7850-48F/48FS Built-in SFP ports 1 FastIron 08.0.90mc for RUCKUS ICX Switches Release Notes, Version 1 Part Number: 53-1005731-01 23 Hardware Support Supported Power Supplies Corrective Action: Cease using the 10G-SFPP-TX-A transceiver. Per the information provided in the previous table, leave the required number of SFP ports empty to remain within the allowable power budget before again using the transceiver. Supported Power Supplies For a list of supported power supplies, refer to the Data Sheet for your device. Data Sheets are available online at www.ruckuswireless.com. Supported Optics For a list of supported fiber-optic transceivers that are available from Ruckus, refer to the latest version of the Ruckus Ethernet Optics Family Data Sheet available online at www.ruckuswireless.com/optics.

Device Firmware version File name ICX 7150 2.1.1 fw icx7xxx_poe_02.1.1.b002.fw ICX 7250 2.1.1 fw icx7xxx_poe_02.1.1.b002.fw ICX 7450 2.1.1 fw icx7xxx_poe_02.1.1.b002.fw ICX 7650 2.1.1 fw icx7xxx_poe_02.1.1.b002.fw The firmware files are specific to their devices and are not interchangeable. For example, you cannot load ICX 7250 firmware on an ICX 7450 device. FastIron 08.0.90mc for RUCKUS ICX Switches Release Notes, Version 1 Part Number: 53-1005731-01 25 Software Upgrade and Downgrade Open Source and Third Party Code NOTE Please note the following recommendations and notices: \u2022 Inline power is enabled by default as of FastIron release 08.0.70. \u2022 As of FastIron release 08.0.70 legacy-inline-power configuration is disabled by default. \u2022 Data link operation is decoupled from inline power by default as of FastIron release 08.0.70. \u2022 Use the [no] inline power command to enable and disable POE on one or a range of ports. \u2022 Data link operation is coupled with inline power using the command inline power ethernet x/x/x couple-datalink in Priviliged EXEC mode or in interface configuration mode using the command inline power couple-datalink. The PoE behavior remains the same as in releases prior to 08.0.70 (08.0.30, 08.0.40, 08.0.50, 08.0.61). \u2022 Do not downgrade PoE firmware from the factory installed version. When changing the PoE firmware, always check the current firmware version with the show inline power detail command, and make sure the firmware version you are installing is higher than the version currently running. \u2022 The PoE microcontrollers are pre-programmed at the factory. The firmware can be loaded as an external file. The PoE firmware version string will be kept updated to match the corresponding FastIron software version; however, this is only a cosmetic change, and the firmware itself remains unchanged. If a new version of the code is released, Ruckus Technical Support will notify its customers of the needed code upgrade. Finally, in the remote case that a failure occurs during an upgrade process, the switch would still be functional but without PoE circuitry. If you encounter such an issue, please contact Ruckus Technical Support. \u2022 PoE firmware will auto upgrade to version 2.1.0 fw during the loading of FastIron Release 08.0.80. This auto upgrade of the PoE firmware will add approximately 10 minutes to the loading of FastIron Release 08.0.80 on ICX 7150, ICX 7250, ICX 7450, and ICX 7650 devices.

New PoE Hardware Prevents ICX 7150 and ICX 7450 Devices from Joining a Stack with Pre-08.0.95h Software Per Technical Support Bulletin TSB 2022-005 - Starting with release 8.0.95h/9.0.10d, products running a newer Power Over Ethernet (PoE) chipset do not support older releases, the POE functionality in ICX 7150 and ICX 7450 devices that have the new MCU PD69220 will not be allowed to join a stack running a pre-08.0.95h software image. If you are installing an ICX 7150 or ICX 7450 device that contains MCU PD69220, you must upgrade the stack to FastIron 08.0.95h or later prior to installing the ICX 7150 or ICX 7450 device. Refer to the Technical Support Bulletins page for more details. ICX 7550 Port LED in PoE Mode When a RUCKUS ICX7550-24ZP or a RUCKUS ICX 7550-48ZP device is operating in PoE mode and the user connects a PD to a 10-Gbps port, the port LED comes up green but immediately goes to amber, although the expected LED color is green. When the PD is connected while the ICX device is not in PoE mode and is then placed in PoE mode, the port LED remains green as expected. Workaround: If you encounter the issue, change the device to any other mode, or rotate to the PoE mode again. The LED will then work as expected.
